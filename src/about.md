I'm Nannnss, a 30-something living in rural Oregon inspired by things that feel like magic: pixels and dirt. I spend my time working for a small nonprofit, growing food, reading, learning web development, and strolling through the land I live on.

I built this simple site by stumbling through, but eventually learning the foundations of [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) (and I'm super proud of it).
