2024 felt weird, man. Summarizing a year like last year seems disjointed and messy. I've tried to write this post several times, but nothing is quite sticking. Instead of trying to trudge through and write the post I was hoping to write, I'm focusing on why reflecting is important to me. 

- I want to be able to look back and take note of my personal growth, my evolution.
- I want to be conscious of negativity bias and make an effort to remember the positive moments.
- I want to use the lack of direction I felt in 2024 to set meaningful goals for 2025.

The transitions that happened in 2024 oscilated between life-affirming and devestating. I often felt like I was existing in a liminal space of uncertainty. In all honesty, I lost sight of who I am in some ways. In other ways, I found paths that I had been searching for.

#### Winter

Cold. Snowy. Somewhat lonely. This was a difficult season. I wasn't satisfied with where I was living, having moved in October of 2023, right before the winter season decended upon us. Living rurally, people can hermit a little during this time of year. I often felt anxious in my own home, which contributed to how I was feeling. Luckily, I was able to connect with a great group of people who lived close. We played games and ate food together. This sense of community, even thought I did retreat into hermit mode a bit, really helped ease the discomfort.

#### Spring

Spring felt like a welcome transition - both with the warmer weather and with the activities I involved myself in. The area I live is often threatened by wildfire and proactive fire mitigation is part of life. I participated in a "prescribed burn" on the property I was living. These burns are low-intensity are adapted from [indigenous forest management practices](https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/03/14/how-indigenous-burning-shaped-the-klamaths-forests-for-a-millennia/) that occured before misguided fire-suppression policies were put in place. It was awesome. About 20 people from our little community, several people from outside of the region, friends of mine, and fire professionals came to burn about 3 acres of land. I learned so much and watching the fire burn helped thaw some frozen parts of me.

#### Summer

Summer gave me a lot to look forward to. I moved onto a large swath of land that friends had purchased in July, spent some time fixing up "The 79er" - a vintage (read: old) manufactured home on the land, and started tending to the large overgrown, abandoned garden area adjacent to the greenhouse. This move helped me start to feel alive again. The property was previously used to cultivate cannabis - our region is littered with cannabis grows, so this is not uncommon - and in exploring the infrastructure in place for cultivation, my dormant dream of growing food on a larger scale started to awaken. This both exhillerated and scared me, but the duality was expected and the opportunity I saw lit a fire inside me.

#### Fall

I love fall. I love the colors, the temperature, the winding down. Fall 2024
