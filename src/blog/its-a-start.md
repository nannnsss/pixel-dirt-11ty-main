Welp, after a few hours of research, several days of being stumped, and starting over *again*... I made this!

<mark>It's simple, but I love it.</mark>

It's made with a simple configuration of 11ty and feels like a solid starting point for me to expand and add as I learn.

I'd be lying to say there wasn't a steep learning curve. I tried several different guides to help me get to where I want to be and almost resorted to just using a pre-made starter project to get me going. With some perserverance (and a bit of hyperfocus sprinkled on), something finally clicked and I was able to build this site out with relative ease. Plus, a learned a ton.

I expect to share a lot of various thoughts here. Lately I've been exploring ethical technology, food sovereignty, what the internet has become, how to upscale my food production, and how to make baskets out of the willow that grows on my land. The only niche this site will have is me ;)

Whether or not people will actually read my blog is irrelevant. This is for me and I'm having a great time.
